# Python-ChatBot

This is a simple Chatbot made in Python using the [ChatterBot](https://pypi.org/project/ChatterBot/) module. To start a conversation, just type anything and it will respond back to you. 
Do note that it requires some training to get accurate responses, although training takes some time. If you do wish to train the ChatBot, type "train" in the input, and the training process should begin immediately.

### Requirements:

* ChatterBot  
```pip install ChatterBot```
